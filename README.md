Start
Load and Preprocess Data:

Use GAN to generate synthetic lung CT scan images.
Apply normalization and image augmentations (flipping, scaling, contrast adjustment).
Initialize EfficientNet Model:

Load pre-trained EfficientNet.
Modify final layers for 4-class classification (Covid-19, Pneumonia, Normal, Asthma).
Apply GEP for Hyperparameter Optimization:

Define hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, dropout, etc.).
Use GEP to evolve hyperparameters by optimizing for validation accuracy.
Train the Model:

Train EfficientNet on a mix of real and GAN-generated images.
Apply optimized hyperparameters from GEP.
Evaluate Model:

Test model on real lung CT scans.
Calculate accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix.
Visualize:

Display feature maps from key layers.
